- **Dosing**: Chemical dosing systems
- **Safety**: Leak detection, overflow prevention, etc.

## Filter Combination Options

### Multi-Filter Queries
Users can combine multiple filters to refine their search:
- "Beginner + Arduino + <$100 + Monitoring"
- "Raspberry Pi + Automation + Home Assistant + Advanced"
- "ESP32 + Water Quality + <$200 + Beginner"

### Exclusion Filters
- Exclude specific platforms or features
- Filter out complex projects for beginners
- Exclude projects requiring specific components

## Interactive Filtering Tools

### Web-Based Filter Interface
An online tool allowing users to:
- Select multiple filter criteria
- See live results updates
- Save filter combinations
- Share filtered results

### Command-Line Filtering
For developers:
- Filter projects using command-line tools
- Export filtered results in various formats
- Compare filtered project lists

## Filter Effectiveness Metrics

### Precision Rating
Each filter combination includes a precision rating:
- **High**: Few irrelevant results
- **Medium**: Some irrelevant results
- **Low**: Many irrelevant results

### Completeness Rating
Indicates how many relevant projects the filter captures:
- **Complete**: Captures all relevant projects
- **Near Complete**: Captures most relevant projects
- **Partial**: Captures some relevant projects

## Advanced Filtering Options
