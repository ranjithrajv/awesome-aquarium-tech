Thank you for your interest in contributing to Awesome Aquarium Tech! This document provides guidelines for contributing to this curated list.

## How to Contribute

### Adding a New Project

First, **check if the project fits**: The project should be open source, related to aquarium technology (automation, monitoring, control), and actively maintained.

Next, **verify the project**: Ensure the project has a clear README or documentation, active repository (not archived), open source license, and some community activity or stars.

Then, **fork and clone** this repository.

**Add the project** to the appropriate category in `README.md` using the [standardized format](PROJECT_TEMPLATE.md):

```markdown

*Short, clear description of what the project does*

- **Platform**: [e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi, ESP32, PC-based, Mobile app]
- **Languages**: [e.g., Arduino/C++, Python, Go, JavaScript]
- **Hardware Required**: [List of essential hardware components]
- **Difficulty**: [Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced]
- **Last Updated**: [Date of last commit or YYYY-MM]
- **Maintenance Status**: [Active, Inactive, Looking for Maintainer, Archived]
- **Key Features**:
  - Feature 1

  - Limitation 2
- **Best For**: [Target audience/use case, e.g., reef tanks, freshwater, nano tanks, beginners]
```

Include license information, platform details if applicable, list key features in bullet points, and keep descriptions concise (1-2 sentences).

**Sort alphabetically** within each category.

**Test your changes**: Ensure the links work and the formatting is correct.

Finally, **submit a pull request** with a clear description of the addition.

### Categories

Projects should be added to the most appropriate category:

- **Comprehensive Controllers**: Complete aquarium control systems with multiple features
- **Monitoring and Automation Systems**: Systems focused on monitoring and automation
- **Hardware Projects**: DIY hardware controllers, sensors, and physical devices
- **Mobile Applications**: Mobile apps for aquarium management and monitoring
- **Educational Resources**: Learning materials, tutorials, and guides
- **Specialized Tools**: Specific-purpose tools for particular aspects of aquarium care

### Improving Existing Entries

You can help improve existing entries by:
- Updating project information to follow the standardized format
- Fixing broken links
- Updating descriptions if the project has changed significantly
- Adding missing information (license, features, hardware requirements)
- Improving formatting or grammar
- Updating maintenance status and last updated information

### General Guidelines

Please be respectful and constructive in all interactions. Make one change per pull request for easier review, use descriptive commit messages, and follow the existing formatting style.
